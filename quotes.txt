Peace was never an option
War never changes
if you say you can or you cant, then you are right
Cereal is a soup
Push yourself because no one else is going to do it for you
Being faster than light means you only live in darkness
Do(nt) (Qu)it
r[o]blox death s[o]nd e[f]fect
simplicity is key
The only happiness I get is rubbing my dogs belly
